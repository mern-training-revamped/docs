### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all)

## Setup Repositories

- Clone from template repository.
- Update package.json

You can then type following commands into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

```bash
npm install
```

The command installs all necessary dependencies you need to run the app.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds your app locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you at http://localhost:4000/dev.
